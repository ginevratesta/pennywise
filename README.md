# PennyWise
PennyWise is an application designed to provide comprehensive management of personal finances, resembling traditional banking or postal accounts. It offers users the ability to track income, expenses, and savings goals in a unified platform.

The project leverages MongoDB with Mongoose and Express.js for the backend infrastructure, ensuring robust data storage and management. On the frontend, PennyWise utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to deliver a dynamic and user-friendly interface. The Material-UI library enhances the aesthetic appeal and user experience with its versatile design components.

## Features

# Transactions
Users can record their income and expenses in the transactions section, allowing them to track their available balance.

# Goals
PennyWise enables users to set financial goals by providing a brief description of the desired purchase, the total cost, and the amount they are willing to save daily or monthly. The app calculates the required savings per period and the estimated completion date, facilitating effective financial planning.

# Savings Management
In the savings section, users can freely allocate funds towards their goals. PennyWise offers flexibility by allowing users to adjust their savings contributions according to their financial circumstances or preferences on a given day.

# User Dashboard
By clicking the "SHOW DETAILS" button on the homepage, users can access a drawer displaying their account information. This includes their registered name, current balance, total savings, a breakdown of savings by goal, and detailed calculations for each goal to aid in long-term financial management.

# Benefits
PennyWise excels in safeguarding users' savings. Any newly added savings are immediately deducted from the available balance, ensuring users are aware of their spending limits without compromising their savings goals.
